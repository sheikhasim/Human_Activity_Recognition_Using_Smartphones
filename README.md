# Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Smartphones
Human activity recognition, is a challenging time series classification task. It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.

OR in other words you can call, it is a multiclass classification problem, for given a new datapoint we have to predict the Human Activity. And Each datapoint corresponds one of the 6 Activities.
